# Code Reading 
This document details the goals, the processes, and other information that 
we hope to adhere too. This document will be a living breathing document that
will change as we see fit. 

Changes could be to the goals that we as a group want to accomplish. It could also be changes 
to the process when we find deficiencies.

## Goals
The goals of Python code reading are as follows;
* Learn how others have solved problems
* Gain a deeper understanding of solutions

## Process

1. Pick a code base that we will read through.
    * Could be a popular one. 
    * Well maintained and manageable code base
    * One you find interesting or use often
2. Should 100 lines of code or less
3. We will have a designated code reader.
    * Like a tour guide

4. The code reader will walk us through the code. During this time
questions can and should be asked if you don't understand something. Divergence 
will provide more than just linear reading of code

## After

After a code reading session we should take some time and do the following;
1. Recap what we learned
2. Ask what we did right
3. What could we do better.
