# Code Reading 
This document details the goals, the processes, and other information that we hope to adhere to. This document will be a living, breathing document.  We will change it as experience leads us to better understanding. 

For example, we could change the goal of the group.  Also, we could change the process when we find deficiencies.

## Goals
The goals of Python code reading are as follows;
* Learn how others have solved problems
* Gain a deeper understanding of solutions

## Process

1. Pick a code base that we will read through.
    * Ideally a well maintained code base
    * One you find interesting or use often
    * Could be a popular one
2. Should be 100 lines of code or less
    * smaller code base has the benefits of:
      1. allow the group to get through it more easily
      2. fewer potential rabbit trails to get lost on
3. We will have a designated code reader
    * Like a tour guide
    * The code reader will walk us through the code 
    * During this time questions can and should be asked if you don't understand something 
    * Divergence is acceptable.  It will provide more than just linear reading of code

## After

After a code reading session we should take some time to do the following;
1. Recap what we learned
2. Ask what we did right
3. What could we do better
